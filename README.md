## Description
Flobi is an application that allows users to grab hourly weather forecasts and a list of events happening in their area from either a simple city search or allowing their current location to be monitored. The motivation for Flobi is the desire to create an easy way for anyone to generate spontaneous plans in their city. With one nice interface, users can make an easy decision based on the weather for the day and the events available around them. This application uses HTML, CSS, Foundation, Javascript, jQuery, the Open Weather API, the Ticketmaster API, and a geolocation feature. The combination of technologies we were more familiar with (HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, OpenWeather) and new technologies (Foundation, the Ticketmaster API, and geolocation functionality) was a very interesting integration and application of translatable knowlege we have gained up until this point of the bootcamp. Flobi’s user story: As a city-dweller, I want to access today’s weather and today’s events in my current location, so that I can liven my day off with spontaneous plans.
